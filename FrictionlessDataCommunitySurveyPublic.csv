I think there is a need to provide documentation to *users* of Frictionless Data that answers the question: ""I stumbled on this Frictionless Dataset. What is that? How can I read it into something I'm familiar with (dataframe, database)?""
2) Although I appreciate the efforts towards a Frictionless Framework, I think the scope is too wide and as a result spread too thin. In my opinion, Frictionless Data is a means, not an end. Frictionless software should reflect that: it should provide fast functions to read, validate and create Frictionless data and then get out of the way. I would for example keep transformation functions out of scope, as these are better served by other frameworks (Pandas, dplyr, SQL).

Note: I think the Frictionless Standards are excellent (and well documented).",Maybe,No,"Allowing schema_sync for Table Schema at a specification level. That would allow one to validate dataset against community-approved Table Schemas, which would be a huge boon to interoperability.",No,,,,Yes,Yes,No,Unsure,Frictionless is the only professional community I know that uses Discord.

I wonder if that impression reflects reality and if so, how the community could collaborate with bigger partners (from e.g. the scientific community) to truly adopt Frictionless Standards in a substantial way."
